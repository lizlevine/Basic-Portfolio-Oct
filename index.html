                 <p>Hi! I'm originally from Detroit, Michigan hand have been living in Manhattan since the 1980's. 
                   I've have had several careers and many interests and hobbies. I began in book publishing, then went on to fashion working
                  in the luxury market sector sector as a buying, selling and merchandising ready-to-wear and accessories. I've also 
                  worked with the architectural and design communities on commercial and high end residential projects.</p>
                  <p>Like many New Yorkers, I found the urban live very stressful and found little time
                    to care for my physical health and well being. This is when I discovered my
                    passion for pilates and ultimately studied with the renowned Romana K., a direct decendent and apprentice to Joseph Pilates. 
                  <p>Today, I spend much of my free time with my beloved 2 year old Basenji who is pictured here with my husband. He comes
                    from a long line of AKC Grand Champions and is following his ancestors campaigning for the title. I spent
                    a lot of time training and grooming him for the show ring. </p>
                    <p>If you are interested in learning more about the exquisite and ancient Basenji breed, please visit my Passion "Pet" Project
