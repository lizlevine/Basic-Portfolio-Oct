          Hi! My name is Liz Levine, and I'm originally from Detroit, Michigan.
          I've been living in Manhattan since the 1980's when the city looked
          and felt very different than it does today. I've have the priviledge
          to explore several career paths and develop many interests and
          hobbies. I began working in publishing, then entered the fashion
          industry working in the luxury market sector buying, selling &
          merchandising. I spent more than a decade in the interior design
          industry collaborating with the architects and designers on
          commercial, hospitality and high end residential projects.
        </p>
        <p>
          Like many New Yorkers, I found the urban life very demanding. This is
          when I discovered a passion for the then unknown, Pilates Method. I
          was blessed to study directly under the renowned Romana Kryzanowska
          (the only living decendent and apprentice to Joseph Pilates).
        </p>

        <p>
          Today, I spend much of my free time with Reiki, my two-year-old
          beloved Basenji who is pictured here as a 12-week-old puppy. He comes
          from a long line of AKC Grand Champions and is following in his
          ancestor's paws, competing for the champion title. Much of my free
          time is spent training and grooming him for the show ring!
        </p>
        <p>

          and ancient breed, please visit my (still in progress!) passion "pet"
